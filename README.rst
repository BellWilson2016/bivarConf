bivarConf
=========

MATLAB code for generating bivariate confidence regions. Does bootstrap resampling of X and Y data and generates resampled trend lines. Then fines the cumulative distribution of those trendlines toward the mean. Note that accuracy will be affected by both the # of samples drawn and the resolution setting.
